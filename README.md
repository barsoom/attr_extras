# attr\_extras

Takes some boilerplate out of Ruby, lowering the barrier to extracting small focused classes, without [the downsides of using `Struct`](http://thepugautomatic.com/2013/08/struct-inheritance-is-overused/).

Instead of

```
class InvoiceBuilder
  def initialize(invoice, employee)
    @invoice, @employee = invoice, employee
  end

  private

  attr_reader :invoice, :employee
end
```

you can just do

```
class InvoiceBuilder
  pattr_initialize :invoice, :employee
end
```

This nicely complements Ruby's built-in `attr_accessor`, `attr_reader` and `attr_writer`.

Supports positional arguments as well as optional and required hash arguments.

Also provides conveniences for creating value objects, method objects, query methods and abstract methods.


## Usage


### `attr_initialize :foo, :bar`

Defines an initializer that takes two arguments and assigns `@foo` and `@bar`.

`attr_initialize :foo, [:bar, :baz!]` defines an initializer that takes one regular argument, assigning `@foo`, and one hash argument, assigning `@bar` (optional) and `@baz` (required).

`attr_initialize [:bar, :baz!]` defines an initializer that takes one hash argument, assigning `@bar` (optional) and `@baz` (required).

`attr_initialize :foo, bar: 'default'` defines an initializer that takes two arguments, assigning `@foo` (required) and `@bar` (optional) with a default value.

`attr_initialize` can also accept a block which will be invoked after initialization. This is useful for calling `super` appropriately in subclasses or initializing private data as necessary.

### `attr_private :foo, :bar`

Defines private readers for `@foo` and `@bar`.


### `attr_value :foo, :bar`

Defines public readers. Does not define writers, as [value objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) are typically immutable.

Defines object equality: two value objects of the same class with the same values are equal.


### `pattr_initialize :foo, :bar`

Defines both initializer and private readers: shortcut for

```
attr_initialize :foo, :bar
attr_private :foo, :bar
```

The `attr_initialize` notation for hash arguments is also supported: `pattr_initialize :foo, [:bar, :baz!]`


### `vattr_initialize :foo, :bar`

Defines initializer, public readers and value object identity: shortcut for

```
attr_initialize :foo, :bar
attr_value :foo, :bar
```

The `attr_initialize` notation for hash arguments is also supported: `vattr_initialize :foo, [:bar, :baz!]`


### `static_facade :fooable?, :foo`<br>

Defines a `.fooable?` class method that delegates to an instance method by the same name, having first provided `foo` as a private reader.

This is handy when a class-method API makes sense but you still want [the refactorability of instance methods](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/11/14/why-ruby-class-methods-resist-refactoring/).

``` ruby
class PublishingPolicy
  static_facade :allow?, :user
  static_facade :disallow?, :user

  def allow?
    user.admin? && …
  end

  def disallow?
    !allow?
  end
end

PublishingPolicy.allow?(user)
```

`static_facade :fooable?, :foo` is a shortcut for

``` ruby
pattr_initialize :foo

def self.fooable?(foo)
  new(foo).fooable?
end
```

The `attr_initialize` notation for hash arguments is also supported: `static_facade :fooable?, :foo, [:bar, :baz!]`

You don't have to specify arguments/readers if you don't want them: just `static_facade :fooable?` is also valid.


### `method_object :foo`

*NOTE: v4.0.0 made a breaking change! `static_facade` does exactly what `method_object` used to do; the new `method_object` no longer accepts a method name argument.*

Defines a `.call` class method that delegates to an instance method by the same name, having first provided `foo` as a private reader.

This is a special case of `static_facade` for when you want a [Method Object](http://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceMethodWithMethodObject.html), and the class name itself will communicate the action it performs.

``` ruby
class PriceCalculator
  method_object :order

  def call
    total * factor
  end

  private

  def total
    order.items.map(&:price).inject(:+)
  end

  def factor
    1 + rand
  end
end

class Order
  def price
    PriceCalculator.call(self)
  end
end
```

`method_object :foo` is a shortcut for

``` ruby
static_facade :call, :foo
```

which is a shortcut for

``` ruby
pattr_initialize :foo

def self.call(foo)
  new(foo).call
end
```

The `attr_initialize` notation for hash arguments is also supported: `method_object :foo, [:bar, :baz!]`

You don't have to specify arguments/readers if you don't want them: just `method_object` is also valid.


### `attr_id_query :foo?, :bar?`<br>

Defines query methods like `foo?`, which is true if (and only if) `foo_id` is truthy. Goes well with Active Record.


### `attr_query :foo?, :bar?`<br>

Defines query methods like `foo?`, which is true if (and only if) `foo` is truthy.

### `attr_implement :foo, :bar`<br>

Defines nullary (0-argument) methods `foo` and `bar` that raise e.g. `"Implement a 'foo()' method"`.

`attr_implement :foo, [:name, :age]` will define a binary (2-argument) method `foo` that raises `"Implement a 'foo(name, age)' method"`.

This is suitable for [abstract methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_method#Abstract_methods) in base classes, e.g. when using the [template method pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern).

It's more or less a shortcut for

``` ruby
def my_method
  raise "Implement me in a subclass!"
end
```

though it is shorter, more declarative, gives you a clear message and handles edge cases you might not have thought about (see tests).


## Philosophy

Findability is a core value.
Hence the long name `attr_initialize`, so you see it when scanning for the initializer;
and the enforced questionmarks with `attr_id_query :foo?`, so you can search for that method.


## Why not use `Struct`?

See: ["Struct inheritance is overused"](http://thepugautomatic.com/2013/08/struct-inheritance-is-overused/)


## Why not use `private; attr_reader :foo`?

Instead of `attr_private :foo`, you could do `private; attr_reader :foo`.

Other than being more to type, declaring `attr_reader` after `private` will actually give you a warning (deserved or not) if you run Ruby with warnings turned on.

If you don't want the dependency on `attr_extras`, you can get rid of the warnings with `attr_reader :foo; private :foo`. Or just define a regular private method.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem "attr_extras"

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install attr_extras


## Running the tests

Run then with:

`rake`

Or to see warnings (try not to have any):

`RUBYOPT=-w rake`
